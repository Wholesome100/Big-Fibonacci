# Big Fibonacci
This was a university project for Data Structures, the specifics of which are detailed in Fibonacci.pdf

Please, do not copy this code to complete assignments. Logical observation is welcome, but copying will not instill the necessary skills and confidence to succeed.

# Running the Code
Clone the repository into your preferred development environment.
The code can be run from the command line, but I opted for Visual Studio 2022 (MSVC Compiler)

With Visual Studio, open the .sln file. In the source files, only Fibonacci.c and testcase04.c are included.
Run the Local Windows Debugger to execute the program for testcase04.

The other test cases in the Testcases folder will need to be included/excluded as desired due to the project requirements.
(Every testcase has an indivdual main() function to facilitate fast grading)

The output for each test case can be checked against their respective file in the Outputs folder.
